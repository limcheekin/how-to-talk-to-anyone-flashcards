Instead, look at the other person’s face for a second. Pause. Soak in their persona. Then let a big, warm, responsive smile flood over your face and overflow into your eyes. It will engulf the recipient like a warm wave. The split-second delay convinces people your flooding smile is genuine and only for them." },

The instant the two of you are introduced, reward your new acquaintance. Give the warm smile, the total-body turn, and the undivided attention you would give a tiny tyke who crawled up to your feet, turned a precious face up to yours, and beamed a big toothless grin. Pivoting 100 percent toward the new person shouts \"I think you are very, very special.\"" },

How to Make Someone Feel Like an Old Friend at Once", backTitle: "Hello Old Friend", description: "When meeting someone, imagine he or she is an old friend (an old customer, an old beloved, or someone else you had great affection for). How sad, the vicissitudes of life tore you two asunder. But, holy mackerel, now the party (the meeting, the convention) has reunited you with your long-lost old friend! The joyful experience starts a remarkable chain reaction in your body from the subconscious softening of your eyebrows to the positioning of your toes—and everything between." },

How to Come Across as 100 Percent Credible to Everyone", backTitle: "Limit the Fidget", description: "Whenever your conversation really counts, let your nose itch, your ear tingle, or your foot prickle. Do not fidget, twitch, wiggle, squirm, or scratch. And above all, keep your paws away from your puss. Hand motions near your face and all fidgeting can give your listener the gut feeling you’re fibbing." },

No matter how prosaic the text, an empathetic mood, a positive demeanor, and passionate delivery make you sound exciting." },

How to Make People Want to Start a Conversation with You", backTitle: "Always Wear a Whatzit", description: "Whenever you go to a gathering, wear or carry something unusual to give people who find you the delightful stranger across the crowded room an excuse to approach. \"Excuse me, I couldn’t help but notice your . . . what IS that?\"" },

How to Meet the People You Want to Meet", backTitle: "Whoozat", description: "Whoozat is the most effective, least used (by non-politicians) meeting-people device ever contrived.

Just sidle up behind the swarm of folks you want to infiltrate and open your ears. Wait for any flimsy excuse and jump in with \"Excuse me, I couldn’t help but overhear. . . .\" Will they be taken aback? Momentarily. Will they get over it? Momentarily. Will you be in the conversation? Absolutely!" },

How to Make \"Where Are You From?\" Sound Exciting", backTitle: "Never the Naked City", description: "Whenever someone asks you the inevitable, \"And where are you from?\" never, ever, unfairly challenge their powers of imagination with a one-word answer. Learn some engaging facts about your hometown that conversational partners can comment on. Then, when they say something clever in response to your bait, they think you’re a great conversationalist." },

How to Come Out a Winner Every Time They Ask, \"And What Do You Do?\"", backTitle: "Never the Naked Job", description: "When asked the inevitable \"And what do you do,\" you may think \"I’m an economist/an educator/an engineer\" is giving enough information to engender good conversation. However, to one who is not an economist, educator, or an engineer, you might as well be saying \"I’m a paleontologist/psychoanalyst/pornographer.\" Flesh it out. Throw out some delicious facts about your job for new acquaintances to munch on. Otherwise, they’ll soon excuse themselves, preferring the snacks back at the cheese tray." },
            { frontTitle: "17. How to Introduce People Like the Host(ess) with the Most(est)", backTitle: "Never the Naked Introduction", description: "When introducing people, don’t throw out an unbaited hook and stand there grinning like a big clam, leaving the newlymets to flutter their fins and fish for a topic. Bait the conversational hook to get them in the swim of things. Then you’re free to stay or float on to the next networking opportunity." },
            { frontTitle: "18. How to Resuscitate a Dying Conversation", backTitle: "Be a Word Detective", description: "Like a good gumshoe, listen to your conversation partner’s every word for clues to his or her preferred topic. The evidence is bound to slip out. Then spring on that subject like a sleuth on to a slip of the tongue. Like Sherlock Holmes, you have the clue to the subject that’s hot for the other person." },
            { frontTitle: "19. How to Enthrall 'Em with Your Choice of Topic—Them!", backTitle: "The Swiveling Spotlight", description: "When you meet someone, imagine a giant revolving spotlight between you. When you’re talking, the spotlight is on you. When the new person is speaking, it’s shining on him or her. If you shine it brightly enough, the stranger will be blinded to the fact that you have hardly said a word about yourself. The longer you keep it shining away from you, the more interesting he or she finds you." },
            { frontTitle: "20. How to Never Need to Wonder, \"What Do I Say Next?\"", backTitle: "Parroting", description: "Never be left speechless again. Like a parrot, simply repeat the last few words your conversation partner says. That puts the ball right back in his or her court, and then all you need to do is listen." },
            { frontTitle: "21. How to Get 'Em Happily Chatting (So You Can Slip Away if You Want To!)", backTitle: "Encore!", description: "The sweetest sound a performer can hear welling up out of the applause is \"Encore! Encore! Let’s hear it again!\" The sweetest sound your conversation partner can hear from your lips when you’re talking with a group of people is \"Tell them about the time you . . .\" Whenever you’re at a meeting or party with someone important to you, think of some stories he or she told you. Choose an appropriate one from their repertoire that the crowd will enjoy. Then shine the spotlight by requesting a repeat performance." },
            { frontTitle: "22. How to Come Across as a Positive Person", backTitle: "Ac-cen-tu-ate the Pos-i-tive", description: "When first meeting someone, lock your closet door and save your skeletons for later. You and your new good friend can invite the skeletons out, have a good laugh, and dance over their bones later in the relationship. But now’s the time, as the old song says, to \"ac-cen-tu-ate the pos-i-tive and elim-i-nate the neg-a-tive.\"" },
            { frontTitle: "23. How to Always Have Something Interesting to Say", backTitle: "The Latest News . . . Don’t Leave Home Without It", description: "The last move to make before leaving for the party—even after you’ve given yourself final approval in the mirror—is to turn on the radio news or scan your newspaper. Anything that happened today is good material. Knowing the big-deal news of the moment is also a defensive move that rescues you from putting your foot in your mouth by asking what everybody’s talking about. Foot-in-mouth is not very tasty in public, especially when it’s surrounded by egg-on-face." },
            // Part Three
            { frontTitle: "24. How to Find Out What They Do (Without Even Asking!)", backTitle: "What Do You Do—Not!", description: "A sure sign you’re a Somebody is the conspicuous absence of the question, \"What do you do?\" (You determine this, of course, but not with those four dirty words that label you as either a ruthless networker, a social climber, a gold-digging husband or wife hunter, or someone who’s never strolled along Easy Street.)" },
            { frontTitle: "25. How to Know What to Say When They Ask, \"What Do You Do?\"", backTitle: "The Nutshell Rèsumè", description: "Just as job-seeking top managers roll a different written rèsumè off their printers for each position they’re applying for, let a different true story about your professional life roll off your tongue for each listener. Before responding to \"What do you do?\" ask yourself, \"What possible interest could this person have in my answer? Could he refer business to me? Buy from me? Hire me? Marry my sister? Become my buddy?\" Wherever you go, pack a nutshell about your own life to work into your communications bag of tricks." },
            { frontTitle: "26. How to Sound Even Smarter Than You Are", backTitle: "Your Personal Thesaurus", description: "Look up some common words you use every day in the thesaurus. Then, like slipping your feet into a new pair of shoes, slip your tongue into a few new words to see how they fit. If you like them, start making permanent replacements. Remember, only fifty words makes the difference between a rich, creative vocabulary and an average, middle-of-the-road one. Substitute a word a day for two months and you’ll be in the verbally elite." },
            { frontTitle: "27. How to Not Sound Anxious (Let Them Discover Your Similarity)", backTitle: "Kill the Quick \"Me, Too!\"", description: "Whenever you have something in common with someone, the longer you wait to reveal it, the more moved (and impressed) he or she will be. You emerge as a confident big cat, not a lonely little stray, hungry for quick connection with a stranger. P.S.: Don’t wait too long to reveal your shared interest or it will seem like you’re being tricky." },
            { frontTitle: "28. How to Be a \"You-Firstie\" to Gain Their Respect and Affection", backTitle: "Comm-YOU-nication", description: "Start every appropriate sentence with you. It immediately grabs your listener’s attention. It gets a more positive response because it pushes the pride button and saves them having to translate it into \"me\" terms. When you sprinkle you as liberally as salt and pepper throughout your conversation, your listeners find it an irresistible spice." },
            { frontTitle: "29. How to Make Them Feel You \"Don’t Smile at Just Anybody\"", backTitle: "The Exclusive Smile", description: "If you flash everybody the same smile, like a Confederate dollar, it loses value. When meeting groups of people, grace each with a distinct smile. Let your smiles grow out of the beauty big players find in each new face. If one person in a group is more important to you than the others, reserve an especially big, flooding smile just for him or her." },
            { frontTitle: "30. How to Avoid Sounding Like a Jerk", backTitle: "Don’t Touch a Clichè with a Ten-Foot Pole", description: "Be on guard. Don’t use any clichès when chatting with big winners. Don’t even touch one with a ten-foot pole. Never? Not even when hell freezes over? Not unless you want to sound dumb as a doorknob." },
            { frontTitle: "31. How to Use Motivational Speakers' Techniques to Enhance Your Conversation", backTitle: "Use Jawsmith’s Jive", description: "Whether you’re standing behind a podium facing thousands or behind the barbecue grill facing your family, you’ll move, amuse, and motivate with the same skills. Read speakers' books to cull quotations, pull pearls of wisdom, and get gems to tickle their funny bones. Find a few bon mots to let casually slide off your tongue on chosen occasions. If you want to be notable, dream up a crazy quotable. Make 'em rhyme, make 'em clever, or make 'em funny. Above all, make 'em relevant." },
            { frontTitle: "32. How to Banter Like the Big Shots Do (Big Winners Tell It Like It Is)", backTitle: "Call a Spade a Spade", description: "Don’t hide behind euphemisms. Call a spade a spade. That doesn’t mean big cats use tasteless four-letter words when perfectly decent five- and six-letter ones exist. They’ve simply learned the King’s English, and they speak it." },
            { frontTitle: "33. How to Avoid the World’s Worst Conversational Habit", backTitle: "Trash the Teasing", description: "A dead giveaway of a little cat is his or her proclivity to tease. An innocent joke at someone else’s expense may get you a cheap laugh. Nevertheless, the big cats will have the last one. Because you’ll bang your head against the glass ceiling they construct to keep little cats from stepping on their paws. Never, ever, make a joke at anyone else’s expense. You’ll wind up paying for it, dearly." },
            { frontTitle: "34. How to Give Them the Bad News (and Have Them Like You All the More)", backTitle: "It’s the Receiver’s Ball", description: "A football player wouldn’t last two beats of the time clock if he made blind passes. A pro throws the ball with the receiver always in mind. Before throwing out any news, keep your receiver in mind. Then deliver it with a smile, a sigh, or a sob. Not according to how you feel about the news, but how the receiver will take it." },
            { frontTitle: "35. How to Respond When You Don’t Want to Answer (and Wish They’d Shut the Heck Up)", backTitle: "The Broken Record", description: "Whenever someone persists in questioning you on an unwelcome subject, simply repeat your original response. Use precisely the same words in precisely the same tone of voice. Hearing it again usually quiets them down. If your rude interrogator hangs on like a leech, your next repetition never fails to flick them off." },
            { frontTitle: "36. How to Talk to a Celebrity", backTitle: "Big Shots Don’t Slobber", description: "People who are VIPs in their own right don’t slobber over celebrities. When you are chatting with one, don’t compliment her work, simply say how much pleasure or insight it’s given you. If you do single out any one of the star’s accomplishments, make sure it’s a recent one, not a memory that’s getting yellow in her scrapbook. If the queen bee has a drone sitting with her, find a way to involve him in the conversation." },
            { frontTitle: "37. How to Make Them Want to Thank You", backTitle: "Never the Naked Thank You", description: "Never let the phrase \"thank you\" stand alone. From A to Z, always follow it with for: from \"Thank you for asking\" to \"Thank you for zipping me up.\"" },
            // Part Four
            { frontTitle: "38. How to Be a Modern-Day Renaissance Man or Woman", backTitle: "Scramble Therapy", description: "Once a month, scramble your life. Do something you’d never dream of doing. Participate in a sport, go to an exhibition, hear a lecture on something totally out of your experience. You get 80 percent of the right lingo and insider questions from just one exposure." },
            { frontTitle: "39. How to Sound Like You Know All About Their Job or Hobby", backTitle: "Learn a Little Jobbledygook", description: "Big winners speak Jobbledygook as a second language. What is Jobbledygook? It’s the language of other professions. Why speak it? It makes you sound like an insider. How do you learn it? You’ll find no Jobbledygook cassettes in the language section of your bookstore, but the lingo is easy to pick up. Simply ask a friend who speaks the lingo of the crowd you’ll be with to teach you a few opening questions. The words are few and the rewards are manifold." },
            { frontTitle: "40. How to Bare Their Hot Button (Elementary Doc-Talk)", backTitle: "Baring Their Hot Button", description: "Before jumping blindly into a bevy of bookbinders or a drove of dentists, find out what the hot issues are in their fields. Every industry has burning concerns the outside world knows little about. Ask your informant to bare the industry buzz. Then, to heat the conversation up, push those buttons." },

Are you attending a social function filled with accountants or Zen Buddhists—or anything in between? There are untold thousands of monthly magazines serving every imaginable interest. You can dish up more information than you’ll ever need to sound like an insider with anyone just by reading the rags that serve their racket. (Have you read your latest copy of Zoonooz yet?)" },
            { frontTitle: "42. How to Talk When You’re in Other Countries", backTitle: "Clear \"Customs\"", description: "Before putting one toe on foreign soil, get a book on dos and taboos around the world. Before you shake hands, give a gift, make gestures, or even compliment anyone’s possessions, check it out. Your gaffe could gum up your entire gig." },
            { frontTitle: "43. How to Talk Them into Getting the \"Insider’s Price\" (on Practically Anything You Buy)", backTitle: "Bluffing for Bargains", description: "The haggling skills used in ancient Arab markets are alive and well in contemporary America for big-ticket items. Your price is much lower when you know how to deal. Before every big purchase, find several vendors—a few to learn from and one to buy from. Armed with a few words of industryese, you’re ready to head for the store where you’re going to buy." },
            // Part Five
            { frontTitle: "44. How to Make Them Feel You’re of the Same \"Class\"", backTitle: "Be a Copyclass", description: "Watch people. Look at the way they move. Small movements? Big movements? Fast? Slow? Jerky? Fluid? Old? Young? Classy? Trashy? Pretend the person you are talking to is your dance instructor. Is he a jazzy mover? Is she a balletic mover? Watch his or her body, then imitate the style of movement. That makes your conversation partner subliminally real comfy with you." },
            { frontTitle: "45. How to Make Them Feel That You’re Like \"Family\"", backTitle: "Echoing", description: "Echoing is a simple linguistic technique that packs a powerful wallop. Listen to the speaker’s arbitrary choice of nouns, verbs, prepositions, adjectives—and echo them back. Hearing their words come out of your mouth creates subliminal rapport. It makes them feel you share their values, their attitudes, their interests, their experiences." },
            { frontTitle: "46. How to Really Make It Clear to Them", backTitle: "Potent Imaging", description: "Does your customer have a garden? Talk about \"sowing the seeds for success.\" Does your boss own a boat? Tell him or her about a concept that will \"hold water\" or \"stay afloat.\" Maybe he is a private pilot? Talk about a concept really \"taking off.\" She plays tennis? Tell her it really hits the \"sweet spot.\" Evoke your listener’s interests or lifestyle and weave images around it. To give your points more power and punch, use analogies from your listener’s world, not your own. Potent Imaging also tells your listeners you think like them and hints you share their interests." },
